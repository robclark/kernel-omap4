* Beagle bone geiger cape

  A geiger cape is your run of the mill particle detector measuring
  ionizing radiation. It is also the first example of how a non-generic
  cape can be supported by capebus.

  The geiger cape can not be created via instantiation of a generic cape 
  since the component need to work together.

Required properties:
- compatible: Generic cape nodes must have the form "bone-geiger-cape"
- board-name: The cape's name as if provided by the board-name EEPROM field
- pwms: Pointer to the PWM we require
- pwm-names: Name of the PWM.
- pwm-frequency: Frequency of the PWM in Hz
- pwm-duty-cycle: Duty cycle in percent
- event-blink-delay: Blink delay of the event led
- gpios: GPIO on which an event is detected
- vsense-name: Name of the analog input for vsense
- vsense-scale: Vsense scale to convert to mVolts
- ti-tscadc-dt compatible node for the ADC configuration
- gpio-leds compatible node for the LED configuration

Optional properties:

The geiger cape supports the standard pinctrl properties.

Example:

bone_geiger_cape: cape@1 {
	compatible = "bone-geiger-cape";
	board-name = "Geiger Cape";

	/* note that these can't be versioned... */
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&bone_geiger_cape_pins>;

	pwms = <&ehrpwm1 0 500000 0>;
	pwm-names = "bone-geiger-cape";

	pwm-frequency  = <20000>;	/* 20KHz */
	pwm-duty-cycle = <60>;		/* 60% */

	event-blink-delay = <30>;	/* 30ms */

	gpios = <&gpio4 17 0>;		/* pulse */

	vsense-name = "AIN5";		/* analog vsense */
	vsense-scale = <37325>;		/* scaling */

	tscadc {
		compatible = "ti-tscadc-dt";

		ti,hwmods = "adc_tsc";

		adc-channels = <8>;
	};

	gpio-leds {
		compatible = "gpio-leds";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&bone_geiger_cape_led_pins>;

		geiger-led0 {
			label = "geiger:green:usr0";
			gpios = <&gpio3 23 0>;
			linux,default-trigger = "geiger-run";
			default-state = "off";
		};

		geiger-led1 {
			label = "geiger:red:usr1";
			gpios = <&gpio3 25 0>;
			linux,default-trigger = "geiger-event";
			default-state = "off";
		};
	};
};
