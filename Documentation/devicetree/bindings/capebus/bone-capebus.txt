* Beagle bone capebus bindings

The beaglebone capebus implementation is using a single capebus
node contained in the root node. A beaglebone cape is identified
at by reading an EEPROM at on of 4 possible addresses on the I2C2 bus.

Required properties:
- compatible: Every beaglebone compatible capebus node shall have the 
  form "bone-capebus";
- slots: An array of phandles pointing to the I2C node of an EEPROM that 
  contains the cape information.

Optional properties:

The child nodes of the capebus node can contain either cape nodes
or override nodes. Those cape nodes are described in their respective
binding files.

- override nodes: Describe an override that will take place in the specified
  slot. Many boards during the prototype phase don't have an EEPROM (or are even
  wired in such a way that an eeprom cannot be added). In that case you can
  specify an override that will make everything work as if a real EEPROM was
  there.

Override node required properties:
- compatible: For override node must have the form "bone-capebus-slot-override"
- slot: Identifies the slot# to override.
- board-name: The cape's name as if provided by the board-name EEPROM field

Override node optional properties:
- version: The cape's version as if provided by the version EEPROM field.
- manufacturer: The cape's manufacturer as if provided by the manufacturer
  EEPROM field.

Example:

capebus: capebus@0 {
	compatible = "bone-capebus";

	slots = <&cape_eeprom_0 &cape_eeprom_1 &cape_eeprom_2 &cape_eeprom_3>;

	[cape-nodes]
	[override-nodes]

	bone_adafruit_cape: cape@5 {
		compatible = "bone-generic-cape";
		// read the bone-generic-cape bindings for the rest
		...
	};
};
