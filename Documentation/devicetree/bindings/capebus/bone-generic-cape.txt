* Beagle bone generic cape

  A generic cape is one form of cape that doesn't require any per-cape
  driver for it to function. It is enough for the cape's node to be
  instantiated in the right manner and the functions that the cape provides
  will be available to Linux. A large number of capes fall in this category
  like LCD/DVI/VGA capes, audio capes, capes with a number of gpio buttons,
  capes with standard I2C/SPI/W1 parts etc.
  All that's required is to describe the parts of the cape in the DT and 
  how they utilize the SoC peripherals and it will work, without having
  to write any other driver, or modify the board support package.

  As a sidenote, a large part of the complexity of capes have to do
  with version management. A cape as it goes through various steps of evolution
  changes. These changes are codified by the version field on the EEPROM.
  It is important that version management can be kept as simple as possible.

  The generic concept works by instantiating the child nodes that are
  contained in the cape node. By default nodes that are present in the
  root of the node are activated for any version. Version nodes can 
  contain per-version changes. In the example the da8xx-dt node differs
  in the way it's instantiated, and this is expressed by the version nodes.

Required properties:
- compatible: Generic cape nodes must have the form "bone-generic-cape"
- board-name: The cape's name as if provided by the board-name EEPROM field

Optional properties:
- version: Only valid in a version node, and it contains the list of compatible
  versions this node contains.

The standard supported nodes of the generic cape are:

gpio-leds, tps65217-backlight, gpio-keys, w1-gpio, pwm-backlight

The following nodes are supported via a capebus specific bridge devices, and
their bindings described in their respective files:

ti-tscadc-dt, da8xx-dt, i2c-dt, spi-dt

Example:

bone_dvi_cape: cape@0 {

	compatible = "bone-generic-cape";
	board-name = "BeagleBone DVI-D CAPE";

	/* hacky, since this is not a proper DT platform device */
	/* but until we have DT bindings... */
	version@00A0 {
		version = "00A0";
		dvi {
			compatible = "da8xx-dt";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&bone_dvi_cape_dvi_00A0_pins>;
			ti,hwmods = "lcdc";

			disp-pll = <560000000>;
			panel-type = "1024x768@60";
			powerdn-gpio = <&gpio2 7 0>;
		};
	};

	version@00A1 {
		version = "00A1", "01";
		dvi {
			compatible = "da8xx-dt";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&bone_dvi_cape_dvi_00A1_pins>;
			ti,hwmods = "lcdc";

			disp-pll = <560000000>;
			panel-type = "1024x768@60";
			powerdn-gpio = <&gpio2 31 0>;
		};
	};

	gpio-leds {
		compatible = "gpio-leds";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&bone_dvi_cape_led_pins>;

		dvi-led0 {
			label = "dvi:green:usr0";
			gpios = <&gpio2 18 0>;
			linux,default-trigger = "heartbeat";
			default-state = "off";
		};

		dvi-led1 {
			label = "dvi:green:usr1";
			gpios = <&gpio2 19 0>;
			linux,default-trigger = "mmc0";
			default-state = "off";
		};
	};
};
