Release note:

-------------------------------
   HDMI Tx modules for TDA998x
             by
    NXP Semiconductors BV
-------------------------------

---------------------------------
		/!\ WARNING /!\
If you want to use the HDMI driver from the user space (easier for non-Linux-expert, but needs to have an I2C driver available 
from the user space), PLEASE DON'T USE THE LINUX DELIVERY. USE THE BASIC DELIVERY INSTEAD, and refer to the install_DL.txt note.
An exemple of application is available in HdmiTx\sde2\comps\tmdlHdmiTx\tst\tmdlHdmiTx_ExampleApplication\src folder.
---------------------------------

The release note gives all necessary detail for installation in Linux
kernel and application tunning. Installation is Linux typical and does
not require any HDMI background. A default video and audio setting is
defined in hdmi_tx_init function. It can be changed at will.
There is no porting to do, it is already provided in module. And the
classical HDMI DevLib is embedded in it. But the UserManual is still
usefull for customers who like to optimise the module according to
their needs. If so, feedback is welcome. ;)
Customers who like to drive the module from userland can do it using
IOCTL. IOCTL maps the classical HDMI API. Using the WAIT_FRAME IOCTL,
userland can catch HDMI events like Hot Plug Detect, RxSens or EDID.

So the two main functions the customer needs to take care are :
- hdmi_tx_init : to setup the default HDMI settings. These settings can be
  overwritten using the TDA_SET_INPUT_OUTPUT_CMD IOCTL
- eventCallbackTx : to fetch HDMI events from userland OR add more
  automatic behavior in the module itself. For example basic EDID check
  after reading EDID from the sink.

For customers who like to understand how the HDMI stack works, please
read the TRANSMITTER_TDA998X_SW_UM_Devlib.pdf user manuel. You learn that:
1- this module is a 3 levels stack
2- HDMI core driver API in defined in comps/tmdlHdmiTx/inc

HDCP is delivered in a proprietary module to avoid GPL license constraints.
For customer that uses HDCP, don't forget to get additional stuff from NXP

For OMAP architecture, a DSS plugin is provided. So to activate
HDMI (switch DSS to HDMI output) just prompt on target:
echo "3" > /sys/power/vdd2_lock
echo "1" > /sys/devices/platform/omapdss/display2/enabled
And desactivate : 
echo "0" > /sys/devices/platform/omapdss/display2/enabled

This release note and it's FAQ below covers every known questions from customers
up to now. Thank you for reading it carefully. If you modify the driver, we would
appreciate to gain from your update. So any feedback is welcome.

- FAQ :

  . "Can I modify file tda998x.c ?"
    YES ! It's only a kind of "application" sample of the core driver below.
    Feel free to customize it at will !

  . "Can I modify files in comps directoty ?"
    NO ! Core driver bug shall be discussed with NXP otherwise you may break down
    some patches and introduce regressions

  . "this->driver.i2c_client not allocated" :
    1) Declare your I2C bus usage in arch/arm/mach-omap2/board-zoom2.c as follow :
    | static struct i2c_board_info __initdata zoom2_i2c_bus3_info[] = {
	|        {I2C_BOARD_INFO(TX_NAME,  TDA998X_I2C_SLAVEADDRESS),},
	|        {I2C_BOARD_INFO(CEC_NAME,  TDA99XCEC_I2C_SLAVEADDRESS),},
    | };
    2) Check the TDA target in Makefile :  for example TDA_TX := TDA9984

  . "Video format and plan are strange..." :
    Check tda.setio.videoout/in in hdmi_tx_init() function of tda998x.c

  . "The resolution is not the one I want" :
    Update or create your own omap_video_timings structure and change
    the video resolution of this->tda.setio.video_out.format in hdmi_tx_init()

  . "I want 720p@60Hz" :
    1- Line 860: Uncomment> /*    this->tda.setio.video_out.format = TMDL_HDMITX_VFMT_04_1280x720p_60Hz; */
    2- Line 862: Comment> this->tda.setio.video_out.format = TMDL_HDMITX_VFMT_02_720x480p_60Hz;
    3- Line 1051: Replace> video_720x480at60Hz_panel_timings with video_1280x720at60Hz_panel_timings

  . "RGB colors are swapped, for example I see RBG instead of RGB" : (for TDA9984 and TDA19989 only)
    Modify the videoPortMapping_RGB444 video port mapping in comps/tmdlHdmiTx/cfg/TDA9989/tmdlHdmiTx_Linux_cfg.c. 

  . "YUV signals are swapped, for example I see UVY instead of YUV" : (for TDA9984 and TDA19989 only)
    Modify the videoPortMapping_YUV444/YUV422 video port mapping in comps/tmdlHdmiTx/cfg/TDA9989/tmdlHdmiTx_Linux_cfg.c. 

  . "I2C or SPDIF audio does not work, signals are swapped" : (for TDA9984 and TDA19989 only)
    Modify the enableAudioPortI2S/SPDIF audio port mapping in comps/tmdlHdmiTx/cfg/TDA9989/tmdlHdmiTx_Linux_cfg.c.

  . "I would like to see the EDID of the TV":
    Install the module with debug messages > insmod hdmitx.ko verbose=1 

  . "On the TV display some pixel are flickering":
    Check the OMAP DSS setup and update the dssdev->panel.config parameters

  . "CEC send Samsung vendor ID":
    Yes, otherwise you cannot use Samsung devices... replace is by your own

  . "I don't use OMAP":
    This module contains an OMAP Display SubSystem plugin that automatically
    drives video output of OMAP (video input of TDA). If you don't have OMAP
    remove the ANDROID_DSS (or add your PLATFORM flag in Makefile) and do
    the video bus configuration at your convience. Anyhow, any other usefull 
    plugin is welcome... So please feedback ;)

  . "How to install HDMI module ?":
    See installation chapter above.

  . "HDCP is not supported":
    Ask NXP to deliver you the proprietary HDCP module

  . "HDCP module does not work":
    Ask NXP to provide you your customer seed number...

  . "How can I control the HDMI with my apps ?":
    Use open("/dev/hdmitx") to get access to HdmiTx module.
    Then use ioctl as described in tda998x_ioctl.h.

  . "How can I control CEC with my apps ?":
    Use open("/dev/hdmicec") to get access to HdmiCec module.
    Then use ioctl as described in tda998x_ioctl.h.

  . "How can my application get the HDMI event ?":
    Create a dedicated incoming event thread in your apps and use ioctl WAIT_EVENT

  . "Is is mandatory to create an incoming event thread in my apps ?":
    No if you don't care.

  . "Did I need to create some apps to make HDMI running ?":
    No, you can modify hdmi_tx_init according to your needs and install the
    modules in your init.rc. Hdmi will run automatically.

  . "HDCP device is not authenticated":
    Check your personnal customer ROMCODE and update accordingly your KEY_SEED value
    in comps/tmdlHdmiTx/cfg/TDA9989/tmdlHdmiTx_Linux_cfg.c

  . "Where can I get the the KEY_SEED value for HDCP":
    Ask direcly NXP technical software support

  . "How can I get PC video format like 600x480"
    Watch out the "features on demand" part of Makefile

  . "I don't get any interrupt wired nor IRQ on my board"
    Remove the IRQ flag for timer based polling of interrupt

  . "I want to use HDCP"
    1) Add the nwolc.ko module (or ask it to NXP)
    2) Add TDA_HDCP := TMFL_HDCP_SUPPORT flag
    3) set your KEY_SEED number in tmdlHdmiTx_Linux_cfg.c file

  . "HDCP does not work"
    Ask you key seed to NXP

  . "got unexpected TMDS activity between EDID reading and SetInputOuput"
    use USER_SET_INPUT_OUTPUT flag

  . "I don't want the module to automatically setup TMDS but from userland instead"
    use USER_SET_INPUT_OUTPUT flag

  . "I2S audio does not work, N value is not good"
    Check the audio frequence in hdmi_tx_init or using IOCTL TDA_SET_AUDIO_INPUT_CMD
    For example, N=6144 at 48KHz, but N=6272 at 44.1Khz

  . "I2S audio does not work, CTS value is not good"
    Check the audio I2S format in hdmi_tx_init or using IOCTL TDA_SET_AUDIO_INPUT_CMD
    CTS is automatically computed by the TDA accordingly to the audio input
    so accordingly to the upstream settings (like an OMAP ;)
    For example, I2S 16 bits or 32 bits do not produce the same CTS value

  . "How can I change the audio settings ?"
    Put your own settings in setio.audio_in structure. For example : 
     this->tda.setio.audio_in.format = TMDL_HDMITX_AFMT_I2S;
     this->tda.setio.audio_in.rate = TMDL_HDMITX_AFS_44K;
     this->tda.setio.audio_in.i2sFormat = TMDL_HDMITX_I2SFOR_PHILIPS_L;
     this->tda.setio.audio_in.i2sQualifier = TMDL_HDMITX_I2SQ_16BITS;
     this->tda.setio.audio_in.dstRate = TMDL_HDMITX_DSTRATE_SINGLE; /* not relevant here */
     this->tda.setio.audio_in.channelAllocation = 0; /* audio channel allocation L+R (Ref to CEA-861D p85) */

  . "When shall I set audio  ?"
    Default (at module startup) is in hdmi_tx_init
    At will using IOCTL TDA_SET_AUDIO_INPUT_CMD

- Restriction :

  . Remove IRQ flag in Makefile for timer based polling
  . Add ZOOMII_PATCH to reverse clock edge in ZOOMII
  . add TWL4030_HACK to get keypad handle and inject CEC::USER_CONTROL events
  . omap_dss_driver might not be supported by kernel, then hdmi_enable
    and hdmi_disable should be triggered by any other kernel means or
    replaced by direct call from application using:
    -->  ioctl(my_fd,TDA_IOCTL_SET_POWER,[tmPowerOn|tmPowerStandby]);
  . HDCP can be switch off dynamically with TDA_IOCTL_SET_HDCP but not hw engine,
    stop it by removing nwolc.ko module
